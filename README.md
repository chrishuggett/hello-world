# hello-world

Hello everyone.  I've been an accountant for 20 years and am starting on a career change into computer programming once I train up a little.
I love the problem solving aspect of writing a program.  I got very good with spreadsheets thanks to problem solving.

I have a full time job still, in accounting, but once I train up, I'll be looking for a programming position in the Ocala/Gainesville/Orlando/Tampa, FL areas.

I hope after two or so years I'll have solid experience to fill a need for a company nationally as I don't intend on being a second rate developer.
